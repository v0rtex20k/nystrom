#Nystrom Clustering
Final Project for MATH123 in Tufts MSCS Fall 2021


### Notes: 11/23/21
* All methods are currently functional.
* Ng seems to be almost perfect! Pretty fast too
* Fast is indeed faster, but seems extremely dependent on l and r params.
  Seems to sacrifice accuracy for speed. Experimentally, l = r ~ m/4 works.
* Standard is neither the most accurate nor the fastest - weak sauce.
